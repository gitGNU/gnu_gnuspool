These are actually a working set of programs, written originally for
MS Visual C++ using MFC in around 1995 together with a version of the
API library.

MFC is hugely inferior to the standard C++ library in millions of ways
for standard functions but we won't go into this here.

The original idea is to have SPQW as the client interface to
view/manage the spool queue, SPRSETW to configure parameters and
SPRSERV as a printer "daemon".

You can drag and rop files for printing into SPRSERV but you can also
use the poorly documented feature of Windows whereby you can print to
a file by setting up a pseudo-printer in WIN.INI and have SPRSERV
monitor that file and create print jobs.

I agree this is a horrible way of doing it but I don't know enough
about the internals of Windows to do it properly as
pseudo-printers. (Actually I don't want to either!).

So please can some nice kind person come and recode all this lot,
preferably stealing the GTK+ code so the interfaces all look the same.

Please note that the original Xi-Text and xt_* nomenclature has not
been touched so at the very least the API library needs hacking to
look like the GNUspool one.

Also note the need to have special entries on the hosts file on the
[LU]*x boxes. The hostedit program knows about this.

Enjoy!
