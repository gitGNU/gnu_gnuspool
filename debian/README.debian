Before you attempt to start GNUspool, you should include the following
entries in /etc/services.

(You can change the port numbers but all other servers/clients should
also be changed identically).

# Services for GNUspool

gnuspool		48100/tcp        # Connection port
gnuspool		48100/udp        # Probe port
gnuspool-feeder		48101/tcp        # Feeder port for GNUspool
gnuspool-netsrv		48102/tcp        # External job submission
gnuspool-netsrv		48102/udp        # Client access
gnuspool-api		48103/tcp        # API
gnuspool-api		48103/udp        # API (for wakeup messages)

The script /usr/sbin/gspl-servinstall has been provided to do
this for you. It will back off if there are any conflicts.

Please note that the next release of GNUspool will only use 2 ports.

The Provides: on this package are a temporary measure to allow testing.
It seems clear that lsb-core should depend on a virtual package that
is provided by lprng, cups-client and this package, but in the interim,
we're providing lpr and lprng.
