Startup routine shell scripts.

These shell scripts are intended to aid the insertion of startup
routines for GNUspool into the /etc/rc* files for various types of
machine.

Please choose the script closest to what you want to do.

"configure" sets up "Startdirs" which is "."-ed to give the directories.

If it gets stuck it will just stop.

Please help us by adding and correcting these files as various people
change their startup files. Thanks!
