These routines are for emulating LPD interface.

XTLPD emulates a server and converts incoming LPD jobs to jobs for
spr. It also provides directory listing and remove options. There are
provisions of mail messages which is what the spq_extern field is all
about. This has not been changed much since 1995.

XTLPC sends outgoing jobs to printers etc which take LPD protocol. It
tries to be clever and converts multiple copies etc. Probably much of
the stuff in the control file should be hardwired.
