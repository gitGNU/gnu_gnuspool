#
# Control file for lpd client
# We have the following environment variables set up by spd

#	SPOOLPTR	printer name
#	SPOOLHDR	job title
#	SPOOLUSER	numeric userid
#	SPOOLJUNAME	user name owning job 
#	SPOOLPUNAME	posting user name
#	SPOOLFORM	form type
#	SPOOLFLAGS	post-processing flags
#	SPOOLPAGE	current page (not likely to be sensible)
#	SPOOLJOB	job number
#	SPOOLHOST	host name of owning job
#	SPOOLRANGE	page range as m-n -n m- or blank
#	SPOOLOE		0 1 or 2 for all pages odd pages or even pages
#	SPOOLCPS	number of copies

# The following are set up by the client

#	MYHOST		"my" host name
#	DESTHOST	destination host name (from -H parameter)

# We must define a spool directory and a port number

XTLPCSPOOL=SPOOLDIR/xtlpc
PORTNAME=printer

# We must define the format of the C-file and D-file.
# The %.3d gets filled in in the style of printf.

CFILE=cf%c%.3d$MYHOST
DFILE=df%c%.3d$MYHOST

# We kick off by defining the form type by pattern matching the requested form
# type, first default if all else fails

Form	=	f

{ SPOOLFORM ~ *.ps }	Form=l
{ SPOOLFORM ~ *.pr }	Form=p

# If SPOOLHOST is defined and sensible, use that as host name,
# otherwise stick with MYHOST which gets set up before we start.

Host	=	$MYHOST
{ SPOOLHOST }	Host = $SPOOLHOST

# Next we lay out the C-file
# Kick off with standard stuff

:H$MYHOST
:P$SPOOLJUNAME
:J$SPOOLHDR
:C$Host

# Insert pr title if Form type p

{ Form == p }	:T$SPOOLHDR

# Insert print command
# Multiple print commands to give multiple copies are not reliable
# If they are replace the following line with
# ( SPOOLCPS )	:$Form$DFILE
# and put "onecopy" in the setup file

:$Form$DFILE

# Insert delete command

:U$DFILE

# Insert "N" line

:N$SPOOLHDR

# And now for the protocol to send it
# > means send something ] means do it first time only
# < means receive something [ means do it first time only
# * means send whole file

# First say we've got a job for the printer
# Wait for acknowledgement

# Now send D-file and wait for acknowledgement
