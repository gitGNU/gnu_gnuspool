Motif toolkit programs "xmspq" and "xmspuser"

These programs actually do work with the Motif toolkit but not with
LessTif which has some mysterious bugs in.

The programs was originally developed (back in 1993) to use Motif and
was my first ever pair of such programs (and it shows).

By all means build this if you want to but remember that GNU software
doesn't support Motif. Motif isn't really desirable because.

1.  Keyboard accelerators don't work if "num lock" is on. (Not just
    some of them don't work, all of them such as ctrl-q or whatever).
2.  Things like mouse wheels don't work.
3.  It can't do drag and drop like the rest of the world.
4.  You have to have esoteric things in resource files to do things
    like popup menus.

To generate lumps of resource files I use m4 and the macro library xres.m4
