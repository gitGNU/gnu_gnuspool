#	Makefile for Motif-based routines
#	Note that GNU does not support Motif.
#	There are things in LessTif which don't quite work right (Combox Boxes and Spin boxes mainly)
#	so I don't recommend you try to use it.
#	Please note you have to find the Motif includes and library and a home for the resource files
#	"Findappdefloc" may help with the latter
