[ \fIfile\fR ... ]
.PP
\&\fBgspl-rpr\fR
[ \fI\-options\fR ]
[ \fIfile\fR ... ]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBgspl-pr\fR queues up one or more print jobs for the \fBGNUspool\fR spooler.
.PP
\&\fBgspl-rpr\fR queues up one or more print jobs to a remote queue running the
\&\fBGNUspool\fR spooler. \fBGNUspool\fR does not need to be running on the
submitting machine; only the message file and hosts file are required.
.PP
If one or more files are specified, each file is treated as a separate
spool job, with a title constructed from the file name. If no files
are specified \fBgspl-pr\fR and \fBgspl-rpr\fR read from the standard input
instead. In this case the job is placed on the queue with a blank
title unless otherwise specified.
.PP
The standard default options are to print one copy,
preceded by a banner page, with the priority, printer and form
types specified for the user. The standard banner page will contain:
the user name and job title (in large characters), the name of the
user who submitted the job (if different), the job number, its size
and priority.
.PP
Other default options may be set up using environment variables
\&\f(CW\*(C`GSPL_PR\*(C'\fR for \fBgspl-pr\fR and \f(CW\*(C`GSPL_RPR\*(C'\fR for \fBgspl-rpr\fR and/or \fI.gnuspool\fR
files. Any defaults may be overridden by re-specifying that option on
the command line.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
Note that the order of treatment, letters and keywords described below
may be modified by editing the file \fIrest.help\fR \-
see \fIspsyntax\fR\|(5).

The environment variable on which options are supplied is \f(CW\*(C`GSPL_PR\*(C'\fR
for \fBgspl-pr\fR and \f(CW\*(C`GSPL_RPR\*(C'\fR for \fBgspl-rpr\fR and the environment variable to
specify the help file is \f(CW\*(C`SPRESTCONF\*(C'\fR in both cases.
.IP "\-? or +explain" 4
.IX Item "-? or +explain"
causes a summary of the other options to be displayed without taking
further action.
.IP "\-a or +mail\-attention" 4
.IX Item "-a or +mail-attention"
requests that a message be sent in the mail to the user if a job is
awaiting attention, either because it reaches the top of the queue and
the required form type is currently unavailable or because the form
requires alignment.
.IP "\-A or +write\-attention" 4
.IX Item "-A or +write-attention"
requests that a message be sent to every terminal at which the user is
logged in, or by mail otherwise if the user is not logged in, if a job is
awaiting attention, either because it reaches the top of the queue and
the required form type is currently unavailable or because the form
requires alignment.
.IP "\-b or +noatt\-message" 4
.IX Item "-b or +noatt-message"
turns off any job attention messages previously requested.
.IP "\-c \fIn\fR or +copies \fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-c n or +copies n"
sets the number of copies to be printed to \fIn\fR, which may possibly be
zero.
.Sp
The maximum number of copies at a time may be restricted to a number
for each user such as 10. See the output from \fIgspl\-user\fR\|(1) for
information on the maximum number of copies.
.IP "\-C \fInnnn\fR or +classcode \fInnnn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-C nnnn or +classcode nnnn"
where \fInnnn\fR is some collection of the letters \f(CW\*(C`A\*(C'\fR through to \f(CW\*(C`P\*(C'\fR
inclusive (upper or lower case) with \f(CW\*(C`\-\*(C'\fR to indicate ranges, requests
that the job be given the specified \fIclass code\fR.
.Sp
The class code of a job may restrict which printers the job may be
printed on, or which other users can display details of the job.
.Sp
In normal circumstances (except where the user has \fIoverride class\fR
privilege), the specified class code is reduced to the intersection of
(i.e. is "\fIand\fRed" with) the specified class code and the user's own
class code.
.IP "\-d or +delimiter\-number" 4
.IX Item "-d or +delimiter-number"
is used in conjunction with the \fB\-D\fR\fIstring\fR option to specify that
a page is to be considered complete after reading \fIn\fR delimiter
strings. The default value is 1.
.IP "\-D \fIstring\fR or +delimiter \fIstring\fR" 4
.IX Item "-D string or +delimiter string"
specifies an alternative delimiter to the default of formfeed as being
the end of a page. If a number is given using the \fB\-d\fR\fIn\fR option,
then the page is considered ended after that number of occurrences of
the delimiter.
.Sp
The string given may contain standard constructs such as
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        \en
\&        \er
\&        \et
.Ve
.Sp
etc to denote linefeed, carriage return etc. Remember that when the
job is printed, the printer's setup file may re-specify the delimiter,
which will replace the delimiter specified by these options.
.IP "\-E \fIn\fR or +external\-system \fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-E n or +external-system n"
(\fBgspl-pr\fR only) Used internally to signify originating system type. \fIn\fR
may be a number, or the name of a system type given in
\&\fIgnuspool.ext\fR. This option may only be used by \f(CW\*(C`root\*(C'\fR or
\&\f(CW\*(C`spooler\*(C'\fR regardless of other privileges set, as it is intended for
use by \fBxtlpd\fR to set parameters on incoming jobs. Any errors in this
parameter, including permissions, are silently ignored.
.IP "\-f \fIstring\fR or +formtype \fIstring\fR" 4
.IX Item "-f string or +formtype string"
specifies that the supplied form type (with optional suffix introduced
by "\f(CW\*(C`.\*(C'\fR\*(L" or \*(R"\f(CW\*(C`\-\*(C'\fR") is used. Note that not all users may be allowed
to select form types other some pattern, causing the job to be
rejected.
.IP "\-F \fIstring\fR or +post\-proc\-flags \fIstring\fR" 4
.IX Item "-F string or +post-proc-flags string"
causes the specified \fIstring\fR to be passed as the value of the
environment variable \f(CW\*(C`SPOOLFLAGS\*(C'\fR to any program invoked at the time
the job is printed. This might be as a post-processing filter command,
or alternatively some shell command invoked as (for example) a
\&\f(CW\*(C`docstart\*(C'\fR string.
.IP "\-h \fIstring\fR or +header \fIstring\fR" 4
.IX Item "-h string or +header string"
supplies \fIstring\fR as the title for each job, otherwise it is derived
from the file name specified. The title appears on the banner page, if
this is printed.
.IP "\-i or +interpolate" 4
.IX Item "-i or +interpolate"
causes any file name suffixes \fB.c\fR, \fB.o\fR etc of the files from which
jobs are created, to be appended to the form type, unless it already
has a suffix, for example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        gspl-pr -i -f a4 x.c y.ps
.Ve
.Sp
would submit jobs using the files \fBx.c\fR and \fBy.ps\fR with form types
\&\f(CW\*(C`a4.c\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`a4.ps\*(C'\fR respectively.
.IP "\-I or +no\-interpolate" 4
.IX Item "-I or +no-interpolate"
cancels any previously-specified \fB\-i\fR option.
.IP "\-j \fIn\fR or +job\-wait\-time \fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-j n or +job-wait-time n"
is relevant only if input to \fBgspl-pr\fR or \fBgspl-rpr\fR is from a pipeline as in
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        program|gspl-pr ....
.Ve
.Sp
This causes a job to be submitted if no data is received over the pipe
for \fIn\fR seconds.
.Sp
\&\fBgspl-pr\fR or \fBgspl-rpr\fR will still wait, and may submit any number of
subsequent jobs until the pipe is closed by the program generating the
output.
.Sp
Note that nothing can be done by \fBgspl-pr\fR to guess at what output might
appear (possibly halfway through a line) if the program writing to the
pipe does not flush its output buffer after each occasion that it
writes something.
.Sp
Specify a parameter of zero to cancel any previous \fB\-j\fR option, if
required.
.IP "\-l or +local\-only" 4
.IX Item "-l or +local-only"
in a networked environment requests that the job be printed only on
the printers local to the machine at which the job is submitted.
.IP "\-L or +network\-wide" 4
.IX Item "-L or +network-wide"
cancels the request that the job or jobs be printed only on printers
local to the machine at which the job is submitted.
.IP "\-m or +mail\-message" 4
.IX Item "-m or +mail-message"
requests a message to be sent in the mail to the user on completion or
termination of the job.
.IP "\-n \fInn\fR or +delay\-for \fInn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-n nn or +delay-for nn"
specifies that the job should be held on the queue for at least \fInn\fR
minutes from the current time before being printed. The time may
alternatively be specified as \fIhh:mm\fR or as \fIhh:mm:ss\fR, specifying a
delay in hours and minutes, or hours, minutes and seconds.
.IP "\-N \fItime\fR or +delay\-until \fItime\fR" 4
.IX Item "-N time or +delay-until time"
is an alternative to the \fB\-n\fR\fInn\fR option to specify the earliest
time at which the job is to be printed. The argument may be \fIhh:mm\fR
or \fIhh:mm:ss\fR to give the time of day in 24\-hour clock notation. If
the time has passed, then tomorrow is assumed.
.Sp
Alternatively a date and a comma may be prefixed to the time in the
form \fImm/dd\fR or \fIdd/mm\fR depending upon the local convention for date
format used. Thus the resulting argument might be
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        10/11,12:30
.Ve
.IP "\-o \fIhost\fR or +originating\-host \fIhost\fR" 4
.IX Item "-o host or +originating-host host"
(\fBgspl-pr\fR only) Used internally to signify originating host name, in
place of the local host. The host name given should appear in the host
file \fIgnuspool.hosts\fR, possibly with the \f(CW\*(C`external\*(C'\fR keyword. This
option may only be specified by \fBspooler\fR or \fBroot\fR users, but is
silently ignored in other cases as are all other errors. It is
intended for use by \fIxtlpd\fR\|(8) to set parameters on incoming jobs.
.IP "\-O \fIflag\fR or +odd\-even\-flags \fIflag\fR" 4
.IX Item "-O flag or +odd-even-flags flag"
where \fIflag\fR is one of \fBO\fR, \fBE\fR, \fBA\fR, \fBB\fR or \fB\-\fR (the letters
may be upper or lower case), cause odd or even-numbered pages to be
skipped. or \fB\-\fR to reset this flag.
.Sp
\&\fBO\fR causes odd-numbered pages not to be printed.
.Sp
\&\fBE\fR causes even-numbered pages not to be printed.
.Sp
\&\fBA\fR and \fBB\fR are useful if more than one copy is to be printed.
.Sp
\&\fBA\fR causes even-numbered pages not to be printed on odd-numbered
copies, and odd-numbered pages not to be printed on even-numbered
copies.
.Sp
\&\fBB\fR is the other way around.
.Sp
If you do not understand this, all you have to do is remember that
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        gspl-pr -c2 -OA ....
.Ve
.Sp
prints all the odd-numbered pages followed by all the even-numbered
ones.
.Sp
For this to work properly, page delimiters must be set appropriately.
.IP "\-p \fIn\fR or +priority \fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-p n or +priority n"
specifies the priority of the job, between 1 (lowest) and 255
(highest) or some narrower range to which the user is limited.
.Sp
Increasing the priority of a job increases its chances of being
printed earlier than it otherwise would be whilst increasing the
charge applied to the user in a non-linear fashion.
.IP "\-P \fIname\fR or +printer \fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-P name or +printer name"
specifies that the job is to be sent to a printer with the name given,
as opposed to printing it on the first available printer with the
given form type. \fIname\fR may be a pattern to select any printer
matching the pattern.
.Sp
A user may be limited to a range of printers which must be a superset
of \fIname\fR.
.Sp
To \*(L"turn off\*(R" a printer name previously specified by a preceding \fB\-P\fR\fIname\fR
option, put a single \fB\-\fR sign as the printer name.
.IP "\-q or +retain" 4
.IX Item "-q or +retain"
requests that the job or jobs be retained on the queue with copies set
to zero after printing, for explicit deletion, or automatically at the
expiry of the timeout (as set by the \fB\-t\fR\fIn\fR option).
.IP "\-Q \fIhostname\fR or +host \fIhostname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Q hostname or +host hostname"
send the job or jobs to the given \fIhostname\fR. Note that \fIhostname\fR
must be in \fIgnuspool.hosts\fR on the submitting machine and the
submitting machine's hostname must be in \fIgnuspool.hosts\fR on the
receiving machine.
.Sp
If supplied to \fBgspl-pr\fR it will re-invoke \fBgspl-rpr\fR with the same
\&\fIcommand-line\fR options. It is, however, required for \fBgspl-rpr\fR, which
will not try to invoke \fBgspl-pr\fR if it is not supplied (as that could
loop endlessly, this could happen if the \fB\-Q\fR option was in a
\&\fI.gnuspool\fR file for \fBgspl-pr\fR but not in one for \fBgspl-rpr\fR).
.IP "\-r or +banner" 4
.IX Item "-r or +banner"
restores banner pages previously suppressed using \fB\-s\fR.
.Sp
Note that some form types may be set up never to use banners
regardless of this option.
.IP "\-R \fIm\-n\fRor +page\-range \fIm\-n\fR" 4
.IX Item "-R m-nor +page-range m-n"
Specifies that pages \fIm\fR through to \fIn\fR inclusive are to be
printed. This does of course assume that the job has recognisable
pages. If \fIm\fR or \fIn\fR are omitted, then \*(L"the beginning\*(R" or \*(L"the end\*(R"
respectively is assumed, so \f(CW\*(C`\-R 3\-5\*(C'\fR would print pages 3 to 5, \f(CW\*(C`\-7\*(C'\fR
would print pages 1 to 7 inclusive, and \f(CW\*(C`\-R 4\-\*(C'\fR would print page 4 to
the end inclusive. \f(CW\*(C`\-R 1\-\*(C'\fR would turn this option off by selecting 1
to the end.
.IP "\-s or +no\-banner" 4
.IX Item "-s or +no-banner"
suppresses any banner page (large letter user name etc) which is
printed before the job itself.
.Sp
Note that some form types may be set up always to print banners
regardless of this option.
.IP "\-t \fIn\fR or +printed\-timeout \fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-t n or +printed-timeout n"
specifies that if retained on the queue (either because of the \fB\-q\fR
option, or because the setup file has the \f(CW\*(C`retain\*(C'\fR keyword as
described in the system reference manual on printer setup files), the
job will be deleted automatically after \&\fIn\fR hours. The default
value is 24 hours, and the maximum value is 32767 hours (nearly 4
years).

.PD 0
.IP "\-T \fIn\fR or +not\-printed\-timeout \fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-T n or +not-printed-timeout n"
.PD
specifies that if held on the queue without being printed, the job will
be deleted automatically after \fIn\fR hours. The default value is 168
hours (1 week), and the maximum value is 32767 hours (nearly 4 years).
.IP "\-u \fIname\fR or +post\-user \fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-u name or +post-user name"
requests that the specified user name be substituted for the
submitting user on the banner page optionally printed at the start of
the job. The job still remains the responsibility of the submitting
user.
.Sp
To \*(L"turn off\*(R" a user name specified in a previous \fB\-u\fR\fIname\fR option,
put a single \fB\-\fR sign as the user name.
.Sp
The user name must exist on the machine to which the job is queued,
but this will be ignored if not.
.IP "\-U \fIuser\fR or +originating\-user \fIuser\fR" 4
.IX Item "-U user or +originating-user user"
(\fBgspl-pr\fR only) Used internally to signify originating user name. This
may only be specified by users \f(CW\*(C`spooler\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`root\*(C'\fR to have any
effect, otherwise the option is silently ignored, as are all
errors. It is intended for use by \fIxtlpd\fR\|(8) to set parameters on
incoming jobs.
.IP "\-v or \-V or +toggle\-verbose" 4
.IX Item "-v or -V or +toggle-verbose"
alternately with successive uses turns on or off the verbose switch.
This causes job number information to be output on standard error when
job are submitted.
.IP "+verbose" 4
.IX Item "+verbose"
turns on the verbose switch. There is no default letter option
(however it is possible to create one by editing the \fImessage file\fR).
.IP "+no\-verbose" 4
.IX Item "+no-verbose"
turns off the verbose switch. There is no default letter option
(however it is possible to create one by editing the \fImessage file\fR).
.IP "\-w or +write\-message" 4
.IX Item "-w or +write-message"
requests a message to be sent to every terminal at which the user is
logged in, or by mail otherwise if the user is not logged in, when the
job is completed or terminated.
.IP "\-x or +no\-message" 4
.IX Item "-x or +no-message"
turns off any job completion messages previously requested with \fB\-m\fR
or \fB\-w\fR
.IP "\-z or +no\-retain" 4
.IX Item "-z or +no-retain"
cancels a request that the job or jobs be retained on the queue after
printing.
.IP "\-Z \fIlimit\fR or +job\-size\-limit \fIlimit\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Z limit or +job-size-limit limit"
limit the size of jobs to \fIlimit\fR. \fIlimit\fR may be a number, giving a
size in bytes, or it may be suffixed with \fBP\fR to indicate a number of
pages.
.Sp
If a job exceeds the limit it is truncated with a warning message, but
a job is still created. If the limit is prefixed with an \fBE\fR, then
the warning becomes an error, and no job is created.
.Sp
Supply an argument of a single \fB\-\fR to turn off this option.
.IP "+freeze\-current" 4
.IX Item "+freeze-current"
Save all the current options in a \fI.gnuspool\fR file in the current
directory. This will supply defaults for further \fBgspl-pr\fR or \fBgspl-rpr\fR
commands invoked subsequently when started from the directory.
.Sp
Note that no job will be expected from standard input if no files are
specified after including this option.
.IP "+freeze\-home" 4
.IX Item "+freeze-home"
Save all the current options in a \fI.gnuspool\fR file in the user's home
directory. This will supply defaults for further \fBgspl-pr\fR or \fBgspl-rpr\fR
commands invoked subsequently.
.Sp
Note that no job will be expected from standard input if no files are
specified after including this option.

The option \fB\-w\fR causes a message to be sent to your terminal, and the
option \fB\-m\fR causes you to be sent mail in one of the first set of
circumstances. If neither is specified, you should still receive mail
if a filter process produces output on standard error or terminates
abnormally, or if a job is automatically deleted.
(Do not forget you can override the \f(CW\*(C`MAILER\*(C'\fR program
to change this behaviour if required as described in the \fIReference
Manual\fR).

.PP
The option \fB\-A\fR causes a message to be sent to your terminal, and the option
\&\fB\-a\fR causes you to be sent mail in the second set of circumstances.
.PP
If any of these are set in the environment
and you don't want them, you may suppress them on the \fBgspl-pr\fR command
line using \fB\-x\fR to turn off both the \fB\-w\fR and \fB\-m\fR options, and
\&\fB\-b\fR to turn off the \fB\-A\fR and \fB\-a\fR options.
.PP
If your terminal cannot be written to, or you have logged out when a
message to your terminal is invoked, it will be diverted to the mail
program instead.
.Sh "Queue Timeouts."
.IX Subsection "Queue Timeouts."
When the \fBgspl-pr\fR or \fBgspl-rpr\fR command receives its data on
standard input from a pipe, or terminal device, the job is not normally
submitted until an end-of-file indication is encountered. This is typically
caused by the termination of the process writing to the pipe, or by typing the
end-of-file character (often \fIctrl-D\fR) when input is being taken from a terminal.
.PP
In some circumstances the process writing to the pipe may never
finish, or the terminal being read from may not be being accessed by a
human, but the user may wish to proceed anyway with printing.
.PP
The \fB\-j\fR option provides a wait timeout in seconds. If some characters
have been received, the timeout is set before reading more
characters. If the timeout expires before any more characters are
read, then a job is created using the characters received so far and
\&\fBgspl-pr\fR or \fBgspl-rpr\fR restarts, possibly making further jobs if more
characters arrive.
.PP
This cannot be ideal in the case of pipes without some co-operation
from the sending process; this is because if \fIstdio\fR (i.e. the C library functions
\&\f(CW\*(C`printf\*(C'\fR etc, which is also used by many other languages and applications) then the output is
usually \*(L"buffered\*(R" in 1024\-byte chunks, and thus up to 1023 bytes of
the last part of the output will not be written out to the pipe until
the sending process decides to send some more or terminates, and
therefore all but the last of the jobs created by use of this option
may be \*(L"short\*(R" by up to 1023 bytes.
.PP
If the sending process is a 'C' program or other
program which the user has access to, then the user should ensure that
the routine \f(CW\*(C`fflush\*(C'\fR  is used after every block of output, thus:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& printf("Totals for......\en";, ....);
\& fflush(stdout);
.Ve
.PP
Alternatively, the routine \f(CW\*(C`setbuf\*(C'\fR  should be invoked to reduce the buffering on
standard output.
.PP
If the user does not have any access to the sending process this
option may have undesirable effects at \*(L"the seams\*(R" of the various jobs
due to this buffering. The only successful approach would be to insert
a filter process in between \fBgspl-pr\fR and the sending process to ensure
that complete pages only were passed through to \fBgspl-pr\fR.  It is
considered unacceptable to monopolise a printer on speculation that
further data may arrive.
.PP
A parameter of zero turns off the \fB\-j\fR option if it has been set in
an environment variable or \fI.gnuspool\fR file.
.Sh "Delay times."
.IX Subsection "Delay times."
The \fB\-n\fR and \fB\-N\fR options provide for the job to be held unprinted
on the queue for, or until, a specific time.
.PP
The \fB\-n\fR option provides a time interval to be held \fIfor\fR, in minutes, in hours and
minutes, or in hours, minutes and seconds. The following examples all specify
the same time interval of 1 hour and 30 minutes. If no colon appears, a time
period of minutes is assumed:
.PP
.Vb 3
\& -n 90
\& -n 1:30
\& -n 1:30:00
.Ve
.PP
The \fB\-N\fR option provides an explicit time and possibly a date to be
held \fIuntil\fR. The
time may be specified as a 24\-hour clock time with optional seconds thus
.PP
.Vb 2
\& -N 16:35
\& -N 04:28:32
.Ve
.PP
In these cases the given time in the next 24
hours is taken to be the required time. If a different date is required this
can be put in front of the time in the format \fIyy/mm/dd\fR with a comma thus:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& -N 91/2/12,12:30
.Ve
.PP
The year may be omitted, and the date will be taken as a future
date. The date will be taken as \fIdd/mm\fR for timezones less than 4
West, otherwise \fImm/dd\fR.
.PP
This allows the printing of long jobs to be printed at a quiet time,
overnight for example. Alternatively specifying a delay time can
provide an opportunity for thought and possible amendment before
continuing.
.Sh "Environment selection of gspl-pr and gspl-rpr options."
.IX Subsection "Environment selection of gspl-pr and gspl-rpr options."
In common with all GNUspool programs, a configuration file mechanism
applies to \fBgspl-pr\fR and \fBgspl-rpr\fR.
.PP
The environment variable \f(CW\*(C`GSPL_PR\*(C'\fR may be used to contain options
for \fBgspl-pr\fR and the environment variable \f(CW\*(C`GSPL_RPR\*(C'\fR may be used to contain
options for \fBgspl-rpr\fR, and the \fI.gnuspool\fR files may contain the keyword
\&\f(CW\*(C`GSPL_PR\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`GSPL_RPR\*(C'\fR to select options without having to specify
them on the command line.
.PP
This enables you to specify, for example, that you always want the
\&\fB\-v\fR (job confirmation) option, or that when in certain directories,
you always want to use the form type \f(CW\*(C`letterhead\*(C'\fR, or \f(CW\*(C`invoices\*(C'\fR, or
perhaps 2 copies.
.Sh "Saving current gspl-pr or gspl-rpr options"
.IX Subsection "Saving current gspl-pr or gspl-rpr options"
The special options \f(CW\*(C`+freeze\-current\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`+freeze\-home\*(C'\fR cause the
currently selected set of options to be saved in \fI.gnuspool\fR files in
the current directory or home directory respectively. Either or both
may be specified.
.PP
If no file arguments are given to \fBgspl-pr\fR or \fBgspl-rpr\fR when one or both
of these keywords are specified, then the program will not expect to
find data on the standard input. If file arguments are given, then the
\&\f(CW\*(C`.gnuspool\*(C'\fR file or files are saved before the file arguments are
processed. If the \f(CW\*(C`.gnuspool\*(C'\fR file cannot be saved, perhaps because the
access permission to the current directory is inappropriate, the jobs
files specified will still be queued, the program will not fatally
abort.
.Sh "Interaction of gspl-pr and gspl-rpr"
.IX Subsection "Interaction of gspl-pr and gspl-rpr"
If the \fB\-Q\fR option is given to \fBgspl-pr\fR, either on the command line or
in the environment or \fB.gnuspool\fR files, then \fBgspl-rpr\fR will be invoked
with the same command line options (but \fBgspl-rpr\fR will accept its own
\&\f(CW\*(C`GSPL_RPR\*(C'\fR environment variable or \fB.gnuspool\fR file options).
.PP
\&\fBGspl-Rpr\fR, however, will not invoke \fBgspl-pr\fR if the \fB\-Q\fR option is not
given; this is an error. Remember that the \fB\-Q\fR option could be set
from a \f(CW\*(C`GSPL_PR\*(C'\fR definition in a \fB.gnuspool\fR file, but without a
\&\fB\-Q\fR option on an \f(CW\*(C`GSPL_RPR\*(C'\fR definition, this would mean that \fBgspl-rpr\fR
did not get invoked with a \fB\-Q\fR option, so this could give an
infinite loop.
