.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
Note that all these programs are in fact hard links to the same
program.
.SH "Starting GNUspool"
.IX Header "Starting GNUspool"
\&\fBgspl-start\fR without arguments, or with one or two numeric arguments,
may be used to start the \fBGNUspool\fR scheduler, \fIspshed\fR\|(8), together
with associated programs, such as \fIxtnetserv\fR\|(8).
.PP
The first optional argument specifies to \fIspshed\fR\|(8) that when
allocating an initial block of shared memory for jobs it should
allocate memory for at least the specified number of jobs.
.PP
The second optional argument performs the same function with
printers.
.PP
These should not strictly be necessary, but on some platforms there
are strange problems about allocating and deallocating blocks of
shared memory whilst a program is running which these are intended to
alleviate.
.PP
If \fIspshed\fR\|(8) is already running, \fBgspl-start\fR will have no effect.
.PP
Printers with numeric names in the other form of \fBgspl-start\fR will not
cause confusion if \fIspshed\fR\|(8) is running.
.PP
All other forms of this command will initialise \fIspshed\fR\|(8), but this is
\&\fIvery strongly\fR not recommended. The scheduler should be started
first, connections to other machines established, possibly using
\&\fBgspl-conn\fR, and then printers should be started.
.SH "Starting printers"
.IX Header "Starting printers"
.Vb 1
\&        gspl-start lj4
.Ve
.PP
will start printer \f(CW\*(C`lj4\*(C'\fR if it is halted. It will have no effect if
it is already running. If it is printing, but it has been set to halt
at the end of the current job, then this setting will be turned off,
and the printer will continue at the end of the current job.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        gspl-start lj4 a4
.Ve
.PP
will likewise do nothing, other than canceling a \*(L"halt at end of
current job\*(R" setting, if printer \f(CW\*(C`lj4\*(C'\fR is running with the paper type
\&\f(CW\*(C`a4\*(C'\fR (i.e. form type up to the first "\f(CW\*(C`.\*(C'\fR" or \f(CW\*(C`\-\*(C'\fR is \f(CW\*(C`a4\*(C'\fR,
ignoring the \*(L"suffix\*(R"). Otherwise, printer \f(CW\*(C`lj4\*(C'\fR will be halted at
the end of the current job if it is running, \fBgspl-start\fR will wait for
it to halt, change the form type to \f(CW\*(C`a4\*(C'\fR and then restart it.
.PP
Only \*(L"paper types\*(R", ignoring the suffix, are compared in deciding
whether the form type is loaded.
.PP
Shell-style wild cards (which should probably be protected from
incorrect expansion by shell using quotes) may be used, in conjunction
with the \fB\-f\fR option, to start multiple printers, thus:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&        gspl-start -f 'l*'
\&        gspl-start -f '*[!a-m]'
\&        gspl-start -f 'l*,*[!a-m]'
.Ve
.PP
will respectively start all printers whose names begin with \f(CW\*(C`l\*(C'\fR, all
printers whose names do not end with \f(CW\*(C`a\*(C'\fR through to \f(CW\*(C`m\*(C'\fR and both
those classes of printers. Many installations include
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        gspl-start -f '*'
.Ve
.PP
in the \*(L"startup script\*(R" to start up all local printers.
.PP
Most of the options (e.g. \fB\-l\fR and \fB\-C\fR) serve only to clarify which
printer or printers are being referred to where there is ambiguity or
the user wishes to restrict the field.
.PP
Names of printers starting with digits will not cause any confusion if
\&\fIspshed\fR\|(8) is running.
.PP
Printers on remote machines may be started by prefixing the machine
name, thus
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        gspl-start -f host1:l*
.Ve
.PP
Printers are not started on more than one machine at once. You should
start the printers as separate commands:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&        gspl-start -f '*'
\&        gspl-start -f 'host1:*'
\&        gspl-start -f 'host2:*'
.Ve
.PP
To run \fBgspl-start\fR, the user must have \fIhalt and restart printers\fR
permission.
.SH "Halting printers"
.IX Header "Halting printers"
.Vb 1
\&        gspl-phalt lj4
.Ve
.PP
will halt printer \f(CW\*(C`lj4\*(C'\fR at the end of the current job if it is
running and will otherwise have no effect.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        gspl-phalt -f 'l*'
.Ve
.PP
will likewise halt all printers whose names start with \f(CW\*(C`l\*(C'\fR etc.
.PP
Most of the options (e.g. \fB\-l\fR and \fB\-C\fR) serve only to clarify which
printer or printers are being referred to where there is ambiguity or
the user wishes to restrict the field.
.PP
\&\fBgspl-pstop\fR is like \fBgspl-phalt\fR, but the printers are halted immediately,
aborting any current job.
.PP
Printers on remote machines may be halted by prefixing the machine
name, thus
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        gspl-pstop -f host1:l*
.Ve
.PP
To run these commands, the user must have \fIhalt and restart printers\fR
permission.
.SH "Interrupting printers"
.IX Header "Interrupting printers"
.Vb 1
\&        gspl-pinter lj4
.Ve
.PP
interrupts the given printer (or printers), so as to enable a
higher-priority job to be handled and the interrupted job resumed at
the interrupted page. Note that this will only work as intended if
page delimiters are correctly defined.
.PP
Printers on remote machines may be interrupted by prefixing the machine
name, thus
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        gspl-pinter host1:lj4
.Ve
.PP
To run this, the user must have \fIhalt and restart printers\fR
permission.
.SH "Adding printers"
.IX Header "Adding printers"
.Vb 1
\&        gspl-padd -l tty15 lj4b a4
.Ve
.PP
adds a new printer with the specified parameters. The \fB\-l\fR option is
mandatory to denote the device name (or network address) as is the
initial form type, in the above example \f(CW\*(C`a4\*(C'\fR.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        gspl-padd -l 193.112.238.95 -N ptr9 a4
.Ve
.PP
adds a network (terminal server) printer with the \s-1IP\s0 address
given.
.PP
Please note that this does nothing to create an initial setup
file, which should be created first.
.PP
Printers on remote machines may not be added with this command.
.PP
To run \fBgspl-padd\fR, the user must have \fIadd and delete printers\fR
permission.
.SH "Deleting printers"
.IX Header "Deleting printers"
.Vb 1
\&        gspl-pdel lj4b
.Ve
.PP
deletes the specified printer. It is a mistake to try to delete more
than one printer at a time with this command.
.PP
Printers on remote machines may not be deleted with this command.
.PP
To run \fBgspl-pdel\fR, the user must have \fIadd and delete printers\fR
permission.
.SH "Changing printers"
.IX Header "Changing printers"
\&\fBgspl-pchange\fR with appropriate options and a printer name (with optional
form type) changes the specified parameters of a printer, which should
be halted (and is left halted).
.PP
To run \fBgspl-pchange\fR, the user must have \fIadd and delete printers\fR
permission.
.SH "Alignment pages"
.IX Header "Alignment pages"
If a printer is in \*(L"awaiting operator\*(R" state, then \fBgspl-ok\fR and
\&\fBgspl-nok\fR may be used to communicate with it.
.PP
If it is in single sheet mode, then the printer will be continued
identically whichever command is used.
.PP
If it is waiting for the approval of an alignment page, \fBgspl-ok\fR will
grant approval and continue with printing, \fBgspl-nok\fR will disapprove
the alignment page, causing the alignment routine to be rerun.
.PP
To run \fBgspl-ok\fR and \fBgspl-nok\fR, the user must have \fIselect printer list\fR
permission.
.SH "State testing"
.IX Header "State testing"
.Vb 1
\&        gspl-pstat lj4
.Ve
.PP
will return an exit code of 0 (\s-1TRUE\s0 to shells) if the printer is
running, (i.e. printing or idle) and otherwise 1 (\s-1FALSE\s0 to
shells). Some other exit code will be returned, together with a
message, if there is an error, e.g. non-existent printer.
.PP
To test for specific states, use the state names as listed by
\&\fIgspl\-plist\fR\|(1), (in fact it takes the state names from the same file
\&\fIrest.help\fR by default) for example.
.PP
.Vb 3
\&        if gspl-pstat lj4 error || gspl-pstat lj4 offline

\&        fi

The following state names are used by \fBgspl-pstat\fR, which are usually
shared with \fIgspl\-plist\fR\|(1) in the message file
\&\fIrest.help\fR by default. As with other GNUspool
programs, the message file may be edited as required:
