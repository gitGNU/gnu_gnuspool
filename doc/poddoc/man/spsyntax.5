.IX Title "SPSYNTAX 5"
.TH SPSYNTAX 5 "2008-07-12" "GNUspool Release 23" "GNUspool Print Manager"
.SH "NAME"
spsyntax \- option handling for GNUspool programs
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
All of the options referred to in the descriptions of the shell-level
programs for \fBGNUspool\fR below may be supplied in a \fIconfiguration
file\fR (q.v.), or in an environment variable whose name is the same as
the calling program, except that it is in lower case.
.PP
This may enable defaults to be supplied according to the application
from which the program is invoked. However any options and arguments
supplied on the command line usually take priority.
.PP
Additionally by editing the appropriate \fImessage file\fR (q.v.) it is
possible to change the option letters and keywords from those
described.
.Sh "Option types"
.IX Subsection "Option types"
In nearly all cases there are two alternative ways of supplying
options:
.IP "\(bu" 4
Via a traditional Unix-style \fB\-\fR\fIletter\fR option, for example as
\&\fB\-z\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Via a keyword-style option, such as \f(CW\*(C`+zero\-charge\*(C'\fR. Keywords are
case\-insensitive.
.Sh "Option syntax"
.IX Subsection "Option syntax"
The syntax of options is intended to be as flexible as
possible. Options which do not take arguments may be grouped together
as in
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        -wmv
.Ve
.PP
or they may be given separately as in
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        -w -m -v
.Ve
.PP
White space is optional in the case of options which do take
arguments, thus both
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        -p150
.Ve
.PP
and
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        -p 150
.Ve
.PP
are acceptable and have the same effect.
.PP
If the keyword version of an option is given, then it must be
separated from its argument by white space thus
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        +priority 150
.Ve
.Sh "Configuration files"
.IX Subsection "Configuration files"
To save the user from having to specify commonly-used combinations of
options, there are mechanisms enabling these to be supplied to each
program automatically.
.PP
One mechanism is the use of a \fIconfiguration file\fR, \fI.gnuspool\fR in the
current or user's home directory. The other is the use of an
environment variable.
.PP
These files may also be used to specify alternative \fImessage files\fR.
.PP
The format of configuration files is akin to a set of environment
variable assignments, with empty lines and lines beginning with \f(CW\*(C`#\*(C'\fR
being ignored.
.PP
The name assigned to is the same as that of the calling program but in
upper case, for example that corresponding to \fBspq\fR is \f(CW\*(C`SPQ\*(C'\fR
etc. This is the same as for the corresponding environment variable.
.PP
There is a single exception to the above statement, in that the
environment variable corresponding to \fBspr\fR is \f(CW\*(C`SPOOLOPTS\*(C'\fR. This is
retained for historical reasons.
.PP
Usually options are taken from the following places in order, so that
later-processed ones override earlier ones:
.IP "Standard defaults" 4
.IX Item "Standard defaults"
Each program has a set of standard defaults which are used to
initialise the parmaters when the program is invoked.
.IP "User profile" 4
.IX Item "User profile"
In some cases, for example default priority, the user's profile as
displayed by \fIspuser\fR\|(1) is used to initialise the defaults.
.IP "Home directory" 4
.IX Item "Home directory"
The file \fI~/.gnuspool\fR is read, and any options specified therein
(i.e. with an assignment to the appropriate name) are interpreted.
.Sp
Please note that for historical reasons the actual path is
\&\fI~$LIBRARY/.gnuspool\fR. If the environment variable \f(CW\*(C`LIBRARY\*(C'\fR is null,
then this will be equivalent to \fI.gnuspool\fR in the user's home
directory.
.IP "Environment" 4
.IX Item "Environment"
Any options specified in the appropriate environment variable (you
will almost certainly have to use quotes when setting it via the shell
in order to preserve the white space) are read and interpreted.
.IP "Current Directory" 4
.IX Item "Current Directory"
The file \fI.gnuspool\fR is read, and any options specified therein
(i.e. with an assignment to the appropriate name) are interpreted.
.Sp
Note that this may mean that the \fI.gnuspool\fR file is read twice if the
command is run from the current directory. Beware therefore of options
which are cumulative, such as arguments and redirections, and use the
\&\*(L"cancel existing\*(R" options.
.IP "Command line" 4
.IX Item "Command line"
Any options specified on the command line are interpreted last.
.PP
Most options have inverses so that it is possible to reset anything
which may have been set by previously-read options. Extra care should
be taken with cumulative options, notably arguments and redirections,
so that these are not doubled, especially in the case where the home
directory is also the current directory.
.Sh "Option path"
.IX Subsection "Option path"
The above description of the order of selection of configuration
files, environment and command-line options is the default.
.PP
It may be desirable to change the order of selection of options, in
to eliminate some alternative locations or to include others.
.PP
The environment variable \f(CW\*(C`GS_CONFIGPATH\*(C'\fR may be set to a
colon-separated list of directories (environment variables and
\&\f(CW\*(C`~\*(C'\fR\fIuser\fR constructs are appropriately interpreted).
.PP
The symbol \f(CW\*(C`!\*(C'\fR is used to represent the relevant environment
variable, and \f(CW\*(C`\-\*(C'\fR is used to represent option arguments.
.PP
The default value of \f(CW\*(C`GS_CONFIGPATH\*(C'\fR is
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ~$LIBRARY:!:.:-
.Ve
.PP
This provides the interpretation of options in various configuration
files and the environment which is documented above.
.PP
Note that it is possible to eliminate or override the interpretation
of options on the command line by removing or relocating the \f(CW\*(C`\-\*(C'\fR. This
may have very surprising effects especially where configuration files
wipe out the effects of options which may have been set on the command
line. Where the interpretation of options has been removed altogether,
then any options supplied will probably be objected to or
misinterpreted as file names or similar.
.PP
The commands
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        +freeze-home
.Ve
.PP
and
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        +freeze-current
.Ve
.PP
and equivalents do not take into account the value of \f(CW\*(C`GS_CONFIGPATH\*(C'\fR
in any way.
.PP
Finally please note that any non-existent or inaccessible directories
and files will (usually) be silently ignored. If a configuration file
appears to exist but is inaccessible, a diagnostic may be given;
however in some cases this may be misleading due to the fact that
various versions of Unix are misleading or inconsistent with regard to
the error codes reported from an attempt to open a non-existent or
inaccessible file in a non-existent or inaccessible directory.
.Sh "Message files"
.IX Subsection "Message files"
As well as providing help and error messages, screen key assignments
etc, message files also provide the option letters and keyword names
used to specify the options.
.PP
For each command, there is a default message file. For most of the
shell-based commands, this is
\&\fIsprest.help\fR. Alternative message files may be
specified using an environment variable or configuration file
assigning values to a name. For most of the shell-based commands, this
is \f(CW\*(C`SPRESTCONF\*(C'\fR.
.PP
Within the message file itself, the option letters and keywords are
set up using sequences of the form
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        A300:?,explain
.Ve
.PP
Comments and the context should make clear which commands these
options relate to.
.PP
These sequences define
.IP "A state number" 4
.IX Item "A state number"
The state number, in the above example \f(CW300\fR, which is used internally
to denote the argument.
.IP "option letters" 4
.IX Item "option letters"
A single character, often a letter, but in the above example \f(CW\*(C`?\*(C'\fR,
which is the single-character variant of the option, thus \f(CW\*(C`\-?\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
Several option letters, each separated by commas may be defined. To
define <,> itself as an option \*(L"letter\*(R", use \f(CW\*(C`\e,\*(C'\fR.
.IP "option keywords" 4
.IX Item "option keywords"
A string of alphanumerics, possibly including hyphens and underscores,
is used to denote an option keyword, in the above example
\&\f(CW\*(C`+explain\*(C'\fR. Several such keywords may be defined, each separated by
commas. Note that the case of letters in the keywords is discarded.
.Sh "Location of message files"
.IX Subsection "Location of message files"
It is possible to specify alternative locations for message files so
that alternatives are selected according to the application being run
etc.
.PP
The location may be specified using configuration files in a similar
fashion to the search for options, except that the search runs the
other way.
.PP
The search is in the following order:
.IP "Current Directory" 4
.IX Item "Current Directory"
If a configuration file in the current directory specifies a location
for the message file, by means of an assignment to the relevant
variable (for most shell-based commands this is \f(CW\*(C`SPRESTCONF\*(C'\fR), then
this file is taken.
.Sp
Environment variables in the form \f(CW$ABC\fR and users' home directories
in the form \f(CW\*(C`~\*(C'\fR\fIuser\fR are appropriately expanded. The sequence \f(CW$0\fR
is replaced by the name of the program being invoked. (This process
may run recursively up to a level of 10).
.IP "Environment" 4
.IX Item "Environment"
If the relevant environment variable (for most shell-based commands
this is \f(CW\*(C`SPRESTCONF\*(C'\fR) specifies a location, then this is taken.
.IP "Home Directory" 4
.IX Item "Home Directory"
A configuration file in the home directory may specify a location for
the message file.
.IP "Default Location" 4
.IX Item "Default Location"
If none of the above specify a replacment message file then the
default location is taken.
.PP
If a file is specified but does not exist, then this is a fatal
error.
.PP
However there is an additional step to assist the user to set up some
alternative files with a default name.
.PP
Should the file not exist, then the search falls back to a name
generated by taking the last part of the default file name (for
example \fIrest.conf\fR) and substituting this for the last part of the
file name specified.
.PP
For example if the normal message file for the command were
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        rest.help
.Ve
.PP
and the user had specified in a configuration file
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        SPRESTCONF=~/$0.help
.Ve
.PP
then if he or she were to run, say, \fBspr\fR, then the file
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ~/spr.help
.Ve
.PP
would be searched for. If this did not exist, then a search would be
made for
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ~/rest.help
.Ve
.Sh "Path to locate message files"
.IX Subsection "Path to locate message files"
The above search path may be modified using the environment variable
\&\f(CW\*(C`GS_HELPPATH\*(C'\fR. The interpretation is very similar to the description
above for \f(CW\*(C`GS_CONFIGPATH\*(C'\fR, except that \f(CW\*(C`\-\*(C'\fR fields are ignored.
.PP
The default value of \f(CW\*(C`GS_HELPPATH\*(C'\fR is \f(CW\*(C`.:!:~$LIBRARY\*(C'\fR giving the
interpretation described above. Note that this is in the opposite
order to \f(CW\*(C`GS_CONFIGPATH\*(C'\fR.
