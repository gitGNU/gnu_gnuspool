=head1 NAME

gspl-plist - display printer list

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<gspl-plist>
[ I<-options> ]
[ I<printer> ... ]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<gspl-plist> generates a list of the printers, with their current status,
on the B<GNUspool> printer lists, including those on remote machines,
on standard output. Each line of the output corresponds to a single
printer, and by default the output is generally similar to the default
format of the printers screen of the gspl-pq(1) command.

Various options allow the user to control the output in various ways
as described below.

The output can be restricted to one or more named printers by listing
them on the command line.

The default output of B<gspl-plist> looks like the following

 ljet       lp    a4      idle
 epson      tty15 invoice halted
 blue:epson lp    invoice idle

Printer names for printers on remote machines are prefixed as shown
by the machine name and a colon. The output is displayed in the
minimum width to let each column line up as shown, with fields
separated by spaces.

The output format and types of information displayed can be redefined
using the B<-F> option.
