gspl-suspend - suspend assignment of printers

gspl-release - release assignment of printers

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<gspl-stop>
[ I<-y> ]

B<gspl-suspend>
[ I<-y> ]
[ I<n> ]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<gspl-stop> is a program which should be invoked to bring the B<GNUspool>
spooler system to an orderly halt prior to system shutdown. Any jobs
in progress will be saved, and the current page noted for resumption
when the spooler is restarted. Confirmation is requested (reply C<y>
or C<n>) unless the C<-y> option is specified.

B<gspl-suspend> halts the assignment of jobs to printers for a short time,
which defaults to 5 minutes or as given as a time in seconds last
argument to the command, or until released by B<gspl-release>. Again
confirmation is requested unless the C<-y> option is given.

Only a user with the I<Stop spooler> privilege may successfully invoke
any of these commands.

The reason why B<gspl-suspend> this may be useful is that in a network
scenario, where a new host is brought on line, a considerable amount
of network traffic is created, and the assignment of printers to jobs
and the broadcasting of information between hosts can flood the
network to an unacceptable degree.

=head1 OPTIONS

Note that there is no means of saving the C<-y> option in a F<.gnuspool>
file as this is not considered to be sensible. If you have to do this,
put the command in a shell "wrapper".
