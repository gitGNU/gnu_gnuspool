=head1 NAME

gspl-passwd - set passwords for user and API

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<gspl-ppasswd>
[ -I<u> user ]
[ -I<p> password ]
[ -I<f> ]
[ -I<d> ]
[ -I<F> file ]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<gspl-passwd> sets a password for the current user or a specified user
if -B<u> is given. This is separate and distinct from the user's login
password. This password is used by the web interfaces, the Windows
interface and the API.

The reason for doing this is because it is considered insecure to
possibly repeatedly try login passwords from user programs.

If I<any> users have a password set in this way, then I<all> users
will have to to have a password in the file to use any of the
interfaces requiring a password.

Unlike the Unix passwd(1) routine, the old password is not prompted
for and there is no confirmation.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-u> I<user>

Set password for given user. This may only be for other than the
current user if B<gspl-passwd> is invoked by B<root>.

=item B<-p> I<password>

Specify the password to be set other than prompting for it.

=item B<-f>

It is normally considered an error to include a password for B<root>
for the same reasons that the password file is separate. However this
option may be set to insist upon it.

=item B<-d>

Delete the user's password from the file.

=item B<-F> I<file>

Use I<file> to hold the password. The default if no I<file> is given
is F<gspl-passwd>. Any number of B<-F> options may be
given to set up several password files at once.
