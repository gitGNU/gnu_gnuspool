=head1 NAME

spwrite - write messages

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<spwrite>
I<user> [ ... ]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Spwrite> sends messages to users' terminals in response to the C<-w>
and C<-A> options of gspl-pr(1). It is used in preference to the write(1)
command as this picks just one (and usually the wrong one!) of the
terminals at which the user may be logged in, and does not display a
suitable name for the originator of messages.

B<Spwrite> takes a list of one or more users as arguments. It sends
the text on standard input to each user's terminal. The message is
mailed to users who cannot be reached. This facility is available for
use in your own software if you wish.
