=head1 NAME

gspl-spuconv - dump out GNUspool user permissions to file

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<gspl-spuconv>
[ I<-D dir> ]
[ I<-v n> ]
[ I<-e n> ]
[ I<-s> ]
[ I<-f> ]
I<user file> I<outfile>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<gspl-spuconv> considers a B<GNUspool> spool directory, by default the
current directory, takes the user file, which is usually
F<spufile> or F<spufile0.0>, and generates a shell script file I<outfile>, which
if executed, would recreate the B<GNUspool> users with the same options.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 8

=item -D I<directory>

specifies the source directory for the users and I<user file>. It can be
specified as C<$SPOOLDIR> or C<${SPOOLDIR-/var/spool/gnuspool}> etc and the
environment and/or F<gnuspool.conf> will be interrogated to
interpolate the value of the environment variable given.

If you use this, don't forget to put single quotes around it thus:

 gspl-spuconv -D '${SPOOLDIR-/var/spool/gnuspool}' ...

otherwise the shell will try to interpret the $ construct and not
B<gspl-spuconv>.

=item -e I<n>

Tolerate I<n> errors of the kinds denoted by the other options before
giving up trying to convert the file.

=item -s

Ignore file size errors in the saved user file (up to the number of
total errors given by the B<-e> option.

=item -f

Ignore format errors (invalid form types etc) in the saved user file.
