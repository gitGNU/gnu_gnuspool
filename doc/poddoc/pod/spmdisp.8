=head1 NAME

spmdisp - generate messages

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<spmdisp>
I<options>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Spmdisp> generates messages as required by spshed(8) in response to
the mail or write completion or attention options of gspl-pr(1) and
equivalents.

By default, it uses the system basic mailer to dispose of mail
options, spwrite(8) to send messages to users' terminals and
dosspwrite(8) to send messages to Windows PCs.

The messages are generated by B<spmdisp> from the system message file,
which by default is F<int-config>.

The program to be used in each case may be overridden by assignments
to the environment variables C<MAILER>, C<WRITER> and C<DOSWRITER>,
most conveniently in the master configuration file
F<gnuspool.conf>. The program (or shell script) to be run in each
case should take data on standard input and the relevant user name as
the first argument, and will run under the identity C<spooler>.

These variables may also be set on a per-user basis by assignment in a
C<.gnuspool> file located in a user's home directory. The user may also
specify an alternative message file by assignment to the variable
C<SYSMESG>. These programs or scripts will be run under the identity
of the user, typically the owner of the job to be run.

The interface (options etc) are internal to B<GNUspool> and are not
documented here.
