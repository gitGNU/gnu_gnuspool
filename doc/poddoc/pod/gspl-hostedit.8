=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<gspl-hostedit> is a simple curses-based program to edit host tables for
F<gnuspool.hosts>, the host table for GNUspool.

B<gspl-xhostedit> is a similar program using GTK+

They know about local addresses (selecting the correct IP address for a
machine with different IPs on different networks), Windows clients,
DHCP, trusted hosts, manual connections, probes and timeouts.

Input is taken from standard input unless a file name is given, and
output is to standard output unless the B<-o> option is given.

Normally they would be run as follows:

	gspl-hostedit -I /usr/local/etc/gnuspool.hosts

You will usually have to stop and restart GNUspool after you have
done this so that all parts of the system "know" about the new hosts,
however this may not be necessary in all cases, you may only have to
"C<kill -1>" the process id of the xtnetserv process.

Options are identical in each case (except B<gspl-xhostedit> also
takes options parsed by GTK+).
