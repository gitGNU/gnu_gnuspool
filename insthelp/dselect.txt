Please specify a directory for the stated purpose.

You can "walk" the directory tree by typing space or
TAB, possibly after typing the first letter or so of
the required directory.

Space and TAB are slightly different in that TAB looks
around the tree at the same level and space looks down
from the current level.

You can also type CTRL-W to "eat" the last part of the
currently-displayed directory.
