Some devices, particularly on legacy UNIX systems, can
hang up "immortally" with some process being impossible to kill.

This can cause the whole spooler to crash or otherwise become
stuck.

This parameter will cause the last process to close the connection
to close all other connections first and isolate itself so being
"immortal" in this way does no damage.
