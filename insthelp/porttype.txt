This is asking what the method of connection of the
printer is.

It might be:

Parallel - parallel port / centronics interface
Serial - RS232 serial with baud rates (probably obsolete now)
USB - USB connection
Network - some kind of network connection

Most printers these days are either USB or Network but serial
and parallel continue to be supported.
