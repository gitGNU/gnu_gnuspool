This is asking for what protocol type is used to speak to the
printer network interface.

Currently we provide support for 4 types:

LPD - the original LPD protocol (usually safe to use)
Telnet - "reverse telnet" - data is just sent with no handshake
FTP - uses FTP protocol to send data
HPNPF - as Telnet, but checks status of printer after each block

All except Telnet employ some sort of handshake so that errors can
be detected.

HPNPF protocol cab supply more information about erros like out of
paper, paper jam etc.
