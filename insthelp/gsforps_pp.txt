This parameter indicates that Ghostscript should be used
for printing PostScript files.

You must select this if you want to be able to print
PostScript on PCL-only printers.

You must also have Ghostscript and HPIJS available.

Boih are commonly found in Linux distributions.

Select this if you want to have a bit more control over the
output (duplex etc) at the printing stage.
