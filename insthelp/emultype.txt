This is asking which basic type of emulation your printer uses.

We understand 6 types with various options, plus "plain" letting you
customise the handling.

Epson - Epson-style printer
IBM - IBM proprinter

Plus various combinations of PCL, Postscript and combinations

PCL - PCL printer (HP LaserJet) style only
PS - PostScipt only
PCL/PS - alternative PCL or PS, the printer recognises which
PJL - Printer Job Language with options to select PCL or PS

If you have "Ghostscript" loaded, with the filter HPIJS, you
can convert PostScript to PCL. This is often richer in facilities
than just Postscript, so you may prefer this for a printer
which can select either, or you can do it for a PCL-only printer
and select the "use ghostscript option" on a PCL/PS printer.
