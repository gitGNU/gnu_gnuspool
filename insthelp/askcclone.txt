You might want to set up your new printer as a "clone"
(implemented as a symbolic link) of an existing printer.

This will share all the interface and emulation parameters
of the existing printer, being distinguished only by the
device type.

Please reply Y if you want this.

You can opt to "split" it into a printer in its own right
if you want later.
