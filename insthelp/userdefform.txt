Please specify the form type for all users to have
as their default.

It would be normal for this to be something like "a4"
or "legal" or some in-house name, rather than the
installation setting of "standard".

Do not confuse this with the form file of "default".

When the printer starts up, it will use a form file of
the same name as the form (less any suffixes) and will
use "default" if it cannot find that.

Each user should have a default form type name appropriate
to the installation.
