This gives the number of seconds to wait for a write
operation to the device to complete before regarding it
as offline.

Remember that many devices (expecially network ones) have a large
buffer which will continue to accept data and return immediately even
though printing has otherwise stopped, which this will not detect.

Others do not respond to a "write" until a situation has cleared.

You may have to experiment with this parameter.
