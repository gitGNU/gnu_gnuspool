If headers are being printed, this parameter indicates
that every copy should have its own header page.

Without it, copies printed successively will just have
one header page.

All copies of a job are not necessarily printed together
if a higher-priority job is printed in between copies. When
the interrupted job is resumed the first copy printed afterwards
will have a header page in all cases if one is being printed.
