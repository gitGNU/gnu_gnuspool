This indicates whether the serial interface should put a
carriage-return character in front of every linefeed

If you are just printing text, this may be a good idea, but
it is a mistake if your printer ever takes binary data for
graphics or font downloads as it will cause very strange
things to happen.

It is much better to select one of the other options on the
emulation for this.
