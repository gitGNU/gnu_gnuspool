Printer installation help files
===============================

The printer installation suite now uses a Perl script
gspl-ptrinstall and the Perl library in perlinst.

The library asks questions and when the user asks for
help the message given comes from this file.

The helpfile names are given in the routine calls and have
".txt" stuck on the end.

Ones in printer parameter routines have _pp.txt stuck on the end.
