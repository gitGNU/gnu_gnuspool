This lot actually does work but I accept that the whole thing should
be recoded in PHP using the standard shell utilities rather than CGI
programs.

The general idea is that each web page is generated from pieces with
some parameter substitution.

Various parameters, including symbolic names for the HTML template
files, are given in DATADIR/gshtml.ini.

The actual startups are in gsframe.html and gsrframe.html depending on
which CGI library is in use.

Some JavaScript functions are in gsjsfunc.js
