CUPS emulation for GNUspool using Python
========================================

Several programs, notably Firefox and some incorporating GNOME print,
assume CUPS is running and get a list of printers using IPP.

This is an attempt written in Python to emulate CUPS and produce
print jobs for GNUspool.

Each virtual printer that the CUPS emulation produces is a gspl-pr
command with various options.

We have a copier which we use as a printer with various form suffixes
to select double-sided prints, bypass tray and single-sided prints as
required.

You will need to edit "cupspy.conf" to be suitable for your machine
and then run "cups.py" as superuser to start the emulator daemon. Take
down CUPS if it is running.

You may find the "cupspy-setup" Python program helpful for this - you will
need the Python/gtk module.

(At you will need these it isn't installed anywhere by the install stuff and
you might not have python handy.

I'm sure this will require a fair bit of polish - particularly in the
area of PPD files.
